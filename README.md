# Neural Network for Emotion Recognition from Speech


Mono- and cross-lingual emotion classification in recorded speech through a convolutional neural network.

*Read the paper [here](https://github.com/StraysWonderland/Neural-Network-for-Emotion-Recognition-from-Speech/blob/master/Paper/paper_cagritasci_emotionrecognition.pdf)*
### Data
This model was trained and tested on a collective dataset, 
consisting of the english [IEMOCAP](https://sail.usc.edu/iemocap/)
and the french [RECOLA](http://diuf.unifr.ch/diva/recola/index.html) datasets.
These datasets need to be downloaded manually and processed via OpenSMILE using the configuration file in the input folder!
Afterwards transform them to binaries using the write ```binaries.py```

## Getting Started
You can view the notebook here on github. 
### Run the notebook
#### Prerequisites
- Python 3
- Tensorflow
- Jupyter

#### starting the notebook
Simply open a new terminal in the directory and type:
```bash
> jupyter notebook
```
#### setup model
make sure you run all codeblocks from top to bottom to setup the network

### Running the tests
To test the model, you need only to run the last codeblock.
This will evaluate the model and print the accuracy for each testset.


## Built With

* [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) - The framework to create the model
* [Project Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) - Nice and easy python notebooks
